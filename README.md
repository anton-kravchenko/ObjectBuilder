TODO:

- [ ] check how it works with Arrays
- [ ] add instructions for arrays
- [ ] add instructions for `const` types
- [ ] check why `const data = ObjectBuilder.fromBase<unknown, unknown>(undefined).build();` offers .with
- [ ] write docs like for cypress with examples (for types especially)
- [ ] figure out lowest TS version (at least 2.8 because of `extends t`?)
- [ ] pass all in `dist` folder through prettier
- [ ] read about builder pattern (especially in java since there is no way to build an object in-place) (example src/test/java/com/dish/wfm/order/management/integration/EmailNotificationHelperTest.java)
- [ ] test that types from `types.ts` importable from `root`
